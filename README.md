# LearnOut
‘Learn.out’ is a website, which is developed to simplify the task of faculty as well as the student. The website contains three roles: Admin, Faculty & Student. The role of the admin is to create the user (i.e. faculty and students), upload results of students, and handle all the issues/queries faced by either of the users. The role of faculty is to upload video lectures that are best suited for a particular topic, assign tasks to the students (like submission/assignments), upload necessary resources for reference (like books, ppts, theory questions, examples along with university papers) and add important announcements. Finally, the role of a student is to watch video lectures, submit task, etc.
